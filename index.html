    <h2>Dragon Project Revision</h2>
    <p>I will admit, that I did not have much to offer for my first draft of the Dragon Project. Using the recommendations that they gave along with the template website you provided, I was able to create a much better version of the website. One that actually works decently well compared to the first draft.</p>
    <p>Reflecting back on the course, I felt like I started off with HTML pretty decently well, understanding how to do all of the different things that were taught in the lectures, and nailing the exercise projects on the first shot. I did struggle a little more with CSS, but I think part of that might be that coding isn’t a strong suit of mine, though I would love to improve on it and get much better at it. I started to slip a lot later into the course, falling behind very regularly and having to catch up last minute, though I know that’s entirely my fault, I don’t have a reason for why I did that to myself.</p>
    <p>If I had a chance to start it over, I would be on top of everything as soon as it came out, and make sure that I attend all of the lectures that time, they really do help a lot, I was lost several times without them.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>The article that was assigned to us to read starts off with talking about “Graceful Degradation,” and how we seemed to have bent a knee to it for quite a while before making any change. Right about 2004, however, people began to question if this concept was actually useful for web development. At a seminar in late 2003, Steve Champeon and Nick Finck unveiled their concept that would gain widespread coverage, which they dubbed “Progressive Enhancement.” There is a very subtle difference between the two. Other than that, people tend to not notice that there are two different design systems being used in web design at all.</p>
    <p>Graceful Degradation focuses on creating websites for the most capable browsers of the time. They focus on consistently upgrading the website capabilities to accommodate the new browser changes as the different internet companies continue to upgrade their own personal browser. This however led to several users being left behind when the update pushed straight past their browser software and made the website unusable for, say, someone who was using Mozilla’s Thunderbird browser when the website had been updated for Firefox. Progressive Enhancement sort of fixes this problem. Instead of focusing on the browser like developers were originally doing, this focus on the content of the website, making it more available to more people. Content is the backbone of any website, so it would make much more sense to focus on it instead of constantly upgrading a website and leaving potential users behind.</p>
    <p>he article explains Progressive Enhancement like a Peanut M&M. The Peanut in the center is the HTML of the website, providing the content that everyone is going to the site for. The Chocolate layer would be the Presentation of the Website, being coded through CSS. And finally, but definitely not least, you have the candy shell, the JavaScript on the website, providing the users with the interactions they would want to see from your product.</p>
    <p>As I started writing this out, I realized that we were coding through progressive enhancement, making sure we could cover the content with proper presentation and allowing for great functionality all throughout the semester, it was definitely a really interesting article to read, as this is the first class that I had actually gone into web design. </p>
